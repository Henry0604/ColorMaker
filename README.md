# Color Maker

This project is a practice taken from a YouTube video for the realization of an app with MAUI.


## Introduction

This app created from C# with MAUI has the function of generating colors from combining the data in a RBG through 3 sliders, we can also generate colors randomly and finally we can have it through the HEX code that we can copy and use wherever we need.
